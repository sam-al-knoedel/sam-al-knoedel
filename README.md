- 👋 Hi, I’m @sam-al-knoedel
- 👀 I’m interested in python programming, data science, computer vision and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python for image recognition in the field of quantum emitter localization. Furthermore, I'm a newbie in git and want to add it to my repertoire of skills for software development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing specific at the moment.
